if i play wow, it can happen that this rotation get updates/changes often. maybe several times a day.

this includes breaking parts or the whole thing at all!!! so iam sorry if i break it a minute before your m+ key run starts :(

i mostly fix it shortly(within minutes) after and try to never leave the rotation back broken.

 

i used it so far for solo questing in shadowlands, torghast solo (including gauntlet), all shadowland raids heroic, m+15 dungeons

strongly suggest nightfae covenant and as legendaries harmonious apparatus + unity (i will not implement flash concentration. it just sucks)

talents should be: trail of light, angelic feather, binding heals, censure, surge of light, benediction, apotheosis

 

features >>>
works now in every client language! (dispell isnt updated yet(maybe never) and still requires english wow client !!!)

force dps toggle (for solo play like questing or torgast. dont use it at dungeons raids!)

 

hotkeys:

shift = angelic feather on player (in battle out of battle)

left alt = pause rotation

left control = mass dispel mousover

right control = Power Infusion Self

right control = Apotheosis

right control = Fae Guardians

 

in combat >>>

dispel magic debuffs in party/raid with on/off toggle (shadowlands dungeons/raid debuffs + some openworld debuffs + most of latest season 4 mythic+ debuffs from dungeons and the shrouded nathrezim / NEW: legion dungeon debuffs (priority player/lowest/anyone else))

dispel magic enemy buffs with on/off toggle (shadowlands dungeons/raid buffs + some openworld buffs (works also off-target now!!!))

emergency heal player

---disabled for testing--->  auto use healthstone(40%)/ cosmic health potion(60%) / spiritual healthpotion(60%)

channeling/casting cancel protection ( should prevent other casts cancel hymn, symbol of hope, channeling potions etc.)

Spirit of Redemption logic (maybe crap/useless needs testing)

instant popping Explosive Orbs (m+ affix) before regular dps/ heal rotation (works off target / on target). i've done 204 cracked orbs (over 90%) in a single lower kara m+15 keyrun. it's hilarious fast.

pseudo interrupt with chastise (stun talent required) off target on casting enemy within 40 yards

pseudo interrupt with psychic scream(fear) off target on casting enemy within 8 yards

heal kael'thas(need to be in target and line of sight) if player > everyone else HP is above 80%

off target execute with shadow word: death on enemies with less than 15% health (if player health 80+ and force dps on)

off target Shadow Word: Pain (need force dps toggle on)

dps rotation on target (while party over 85% hp or 60% with dps focus toggle active) including>>>

shadow word: death on target with <15% health + player health >80%

Shadow Word: Pain

Holy Word: Chastise

Divine Star (no AOE logic / no facing logic / within 20 yards range to target)   --- i dont use it

Holy Fire

Mindgames (vampire covenant)   --- i dont use it anymore because nightfae is better for holy

---disabled because mostly useless--->  holy nova AOE (starts at 3 enemies surrounding player within 12 yards around player)

Smite

 

self heal > aoe heal > tank heal > lowest heal

 

out of combat>>>

Power Word: Fortitude cast if anyone in roster (party/raid/solo) dont have the buff up

all instant cast heal spells aoe heal > lowest heal

 

TODO:

trinkets / use items ( if i get one that dont suck for a heal)

missing dangerous dispels (if i find any that can be save instant dispelled)
